						Coinciding with the opening of Bruce Nauman’s (MFA ’66, UC
						Davis) retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art, New York,
						this exhibition features the first realization of a
						participatory environment Nauman conceived in 1970. The work
						is a narrow passageway that wraps around an existing room,
						combining colored fluorescent light and closed-circuit video
						to manipulate the viewer’s perceptual experience. An adjacent
						gallery includes artworks that situate the corridor within the
						artist’s career.

								Few living artists have done as much to expand the boundaries
								of art since 1960 as Bruce Nauman. During the mid-late 1960s -
								beginning with his time as a graduate student in the UC Davis
								studio art program, where he received his MA in 1966 - Nauman
								was at the forefront of a generation of artists that placed
								process and activity over static, predetermined forms, and
								that took up language and the body as materials. Unbound by
								traditional divisions of medium, Nauman has moved freely
								between sculpture, performance, film, video, photography,
								drawing, printmaking, and large-scale installation.

									This exhibition coincides with a major Nauman retrospective,
									co-organized by The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the
									Schaulager Basel, the artist's first in over twenty
									years. While the retrospective provides an opportunity to
									survey the full breadth of Nauman's work, the present
									exhibition at the Manetti Shrem Museum focuses on a single,
									exceptional artwork: a large-scale participatory environment
									from 1970-71. Between 1969 and 1976, Nauman designed some
									forty corridors, rooms, and other architectural installations.
									The majority of these installations have been built for
									exhibition on at least one occasion, but Blue and Yellow
									Corridor is one of a handful that have remained on paper, in
									the form of drawings by the artist. Although Nauman originally
									developed the concept for this particular work in three
									drawings of 1970-1971, this exhibition represents the first
									time that the installation has actually been realized.
